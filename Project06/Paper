While doing this project my first step was to put the data into weka and figure out the count of winners and losers. This is when I discovered a space was missing in one of the plusses. After searching for the missing space I finally found it and added the space in the source file. After Completeing this I created code that counted the numbers of each letter and ran the data through weka. I encoutered another problem with the data set however becasue it wouldn't read in the CSV file I experimented and found the line with the problem was o'... After removing the single quote it worked much better. Weka ran with the updated data and I found no significant data with the individual letter counts. I then tested counts of vowles and consenents as well as percentages of each. I tested these becasue they are the hardest to do by hand and the next chance I had to work was on a bus with no power and sadly my battery is quite old. Before the long trip to pueblo I printed out the list of names with winners and losers. On the bus I tried so many different ways that might work but they were all to complicated. Losers had a consenent and a vowel in common between first and last name. Of the set of start and end letters for each name the losers had a duplicate or vice versa. I even asked a math undergrad and a Meterials science Masters student but they were as stumped as I was. Once thing I sould have done was create a list of all winners and all losers but I didn't think about doing that. The final thing I will keep in mind is to create more metrics than just those that are normally percieved as important.
